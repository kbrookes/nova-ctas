# Nova CTAs Development Context

## Urgent Fixes Needed
1. Design settings not persisting in admin:
   - Background colors reverting to default
   - Text colors reverting to default
   - All design tab settings being reset on save
   - Need to investigate save_cta_data method in class-nova-cta-manager.php

2. Frontend styling issues:
   - Container still showing white background despite removal
   - Need to verify style removal in frontend.css is being loaded
   - Check dynamic style generation in output_dynamic_styles method

3. Admin UI issues:
   - Alignment icons still displaying too large
   - CSS fix for alignment controls not being applied
   - Need to verify admin.css changes are being loaded
