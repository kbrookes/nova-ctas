# Nova CTAs Plugin Development Context

## Current Version: 1.1.30

## Urgent Fixes Needed
1. **Critical: Design Settings Persistence**
   - Design settings are not displaying in admin after save
   - Settings are being saved (confirmed by frontend display)
   - No errors in console or debug.log
   - Enhanced logging added but not revealing source of issue
   - Possible issues:
     * Form data might not be properly serialized
     * Admin page might not be properly retrieving saved data
     * Potential caching issue
     * Possible race condition in save/retrieve cycle

2. **Admin UI**
   - Accessibility improvements implemented but need verification
   - Form labels and ARIA attributes added
   - Some alignment issues resolved
